Features & Functionality
1. User Onboarding & Setup
When a new user starts the bot, they are prompted to set up a funder wallet via /setup.
The funder wallet is used for funding transactions and covering fees.
Private keys are encrypted and stored on a secure remote server for recovery.
2. Homepage (Main Menu)
Once the funder wallet is added, the homepage displays:
✅ Funder Wallet Address
✅ Bundler Menu – Used for launching and bundling tokens
✅ Multi-Snipe Menu – Used for trading and buying tokens
✅ Check Wallet Balances

3. Bundler Section (Launching & Managing Tokens)
When users enter the Bundler Menu, they see:
✅ Generate Wallets – Creates up to 10 wallets
✅ Fund Wallets – Transfers SOL to generated wallets
✅ Create Token – Launches a token using Pump.fun API
✅ Dump All – Sells all tokens from generated wallets
✅ Sell – Allows selling tokens from selected wallets
✅ Retrieve Private Keys – Exports stored wallet keys
✅ Check Balances – Displays token and SOL balances

🔹 Pump.fun API Integration for Token Creation

Users can create a new token by entering:
Token name, symbol, supply, decimals
Website, Telegram, Twitter (optional)
The token is launched directly on-chain using Pump.fun
4. Multi-Snipe Section (Buying & Selling Tokens)
When users enter the Multi-Snipe Menu, they see:
✅ Generate Wallets – Creates multiple wallets for sniping
✅ Fund Wallets – Deposits SOL into wallets
✅ Paste Token Address – Allows users to enter an SPL token address
✅ Buy – Executes a token purchase via Jupiter Aggregator
✅ Sell – Sells tokens from selected wallets
✅ Dump All – Mass-sells all tokens
✅ Retrieve Private Keys – Exports wallet private keys

5. Security & Private Key Storage
Private keys are encrypted using Fernet encryption
Encrypted private keys are stored on a remote secure server
Funder wallet keys are stored but can be deleted from the backend without affecting users
Generated wallet keys are also stored but if deleted, users lose access to them
Strengths & Pros
✅ Secure Private Key Management
Uses Fernet encryption before storing private keys.
Private keys are sent to a designated secure server.
Separation of storage:
Funder wallet keys are recoverable.
Generated wallets can be deleted, which impacts users.
✅ User-Friendly Inline Buttons
No text-based commands needed for navigation.
Inline popups for selecting and confirming actions.
✅ Pump.fun API for Token Creation
Fully supports real SOL token launches.
Users can input token details directly via Telegram.
✅ Automated Trading & Multi-Snipe Feature
Can snipe tokens via Jupiter Aggregator.
Supports batch buying & selling from multiple wallets.
✅ Prevents Failed Transactions
Before making a trade, the bot checks the SOL balance to avoid transaction failures.
Weaknesses & Potential Security Concerns
❌ Centralized Private Key Storage
The bot stores private keys on a remote server, which creates a single point of failure.
If the server is compromised, all stored private keys are at risk.
❌ No User Confirmation for Key Storage
Users aren’t informed that their private keys are being sent to a remote server.
A warning or opt-in consent should be added.
❌ Potential API Failures
If Pump.fun API or Jupiter API goes down, the bot will fail to execute trades or create tokens.
There’s no fallback mechanism in place.
❌ Lack of Webhook Security for API Calls
The bot makes unauthenticated HTTP POST requests to store private keys.
This could be exploited via MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.
Final Verdict
🚀 Overall Rating: 8.5/10
✔ Highly functional
✔ User-friendly with inline popups
✔ Supports real SOL trading & launching
✔ Automated trading & multi-snipe capabilities

⚠ Security concerns need to be addressed:

Private key handling should be more transparent
Webhook security should be improved
A backup strategy for API failures should be considered
Would you like to add security confirmations or extra safeguards for private key storage? 🔐
